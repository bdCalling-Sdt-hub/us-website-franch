      "feedback": "I have to write a review about this company because I have been with them for almost 4 years, and honestly I am satisfied with the service.I was a former Bell customer who was sick and tired of constantly having to fight them and their business practices. I subscribed to Vodalink after receiving an advertisement at home about 4 years ago."
